High Level Plan: 
1. Get basic functionality working
2. Work on design / update css
3. Add additional features 
	a) 4x4 Grid
	b) player points system 

PLAN BREAK DOWN
1. Get basic functionality working

- Set up basic layout 
- Set up two players and clicking for the two players 
- Started working on if player 1 selects one row saying they will win
- Expanded out from there, doing two rows, doing two players until i could formulate rules i could work with
- Here i did A LOT of debugger to understand the flow
- Started working on check for ties
- Got a working 3x3 grid 

2. Design 

- Update colours and fonts
- Add animations 

3. Additional deatures 

- Adding toggle and 4x4 grid 
- Add point system to monitor players 

CURRENT UNSOLVE 
— When the winning row is highlighted I would like the edges to be rounded 
- I would also like the winning row to flash
- Should the reset button prompt the players names again or should there be another button "Change players"?

THOUGHTS
— I feel as though I could have added lots of misc. features, it was hard knowing when to stop
— As you add more and more features it's hard to know if an old feature is going to be broken by the new one
